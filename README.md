# Steps to Run the App

# Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
In general I wanted a well rounded app, but my largest focus would have been the project structure. It could have easily been in a file or two but I chose
to structure it out in a MVVM architectural pattern. Having seperate views for various UI components also cleans up the code.

# Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
2 15
# Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

# Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

# External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
I used the Kingfisher library to handle caching the images.

# Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
